# Project Blue Star Website

This is the repository for my organization's (Project Blue Star) website built with Python Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can find the website [HERE](http://www.projectbluestar.org/). `flasksite.py` defines the basic structure of the website. The templates folder includes all the HTML files and templates. The static file includes all the images (photos, logos, icons, etc.), CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript code. This website was deployed using Heroku.
